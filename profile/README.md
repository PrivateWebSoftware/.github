## ‚öóÔ∏è About 
PrivateWebSoftware is an organization that started from free small anonymous chat application in 2016. Now we are creating software that is focused primarily on ensuring the security and privacy of our community. In 2020, we revised and improved the idea of the project, making it much more convenient to use than it was before. Starting from 2023 our community has reached **over 10,000 active users**. We are very proud of what we do and are not going to stop there.

## üé≠ Ecosystem
Our ecosystem consists of software like:
- **Private Social Network** - A private social network hosted on our servers where you can meet and chat with other community members.
- **Self-hosted Anonymous Chat** - Private chat application, that you can host on your own server or on your device (even mobile).
- **Cryptography Applications** - Applications where you can encrypt or decrypt your text or file data.

These are not all the services we provide, if you want to join our community, read below.

## ü¶• Community
